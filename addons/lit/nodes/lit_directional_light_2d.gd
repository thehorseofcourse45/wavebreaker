class_name LitDirectionalLight2D

## A directional light for the Lit system.
##
## Like LitPointLight2D but with no positional attenuation: the node's rotation defines
## the light direction (its local +X aims toward the source), so every receiver is lit
## from the same angle. `height` still tilts the shading vector out of the plane; lower
## is more grazing, higher more head-on. There is no `range`, `falloff` or cookie, and
## directional lights are never positionally culled.
##
## Shares the receiver and shadow code path with point lights via the type flag in the
## light-data texture. As with point lights, `light_mask` reuses the inherited CanvasItem
## property ("Visibility" in the inspector) and is matched against each receiver's
## `receiver_mask`.

# Shared contracts, aliased so LitDirectionalLight2D.BlendMode etc. remain the
# public names; the definitions (and the wire-format rules) live in LitShaderLibrary.
const BlendMode = LitShaderLibrary.BlendMode
const ShadowAlgorithm = LitShaderLibrary.ShadowAlgorithm

## CONE_TRACED (the default): a single signed-coverage cone march - penumbras widen
## with distance, umbras taper closed, and an antumbra re-brightens, all driven
## physically by `source_angle`. RAYMARCHED: the classic estimated-penumbra march -
## fastest, stylized, hardness-driven. STOCHASTIC: splits the source's angular extent
## into `shadow_samples` sub-cones for ground-truth area shadows - the most expensive
## option. Every Lit receiver in the scene is swapped to a shader variant compiled for
## the algorithms in use automatically (by the registry each frame).

## Length of cast shadows as a fraction of `shadow_reach`: every occluder's shadow
## closes exactly at that distance through a natural penumbral tip, so a low sun reads

## it alongside the node's rotation for day/night cycles.

## Angular size (full diameter) of the source in degrees (CONE_TRACED / STOCHASTIC):
## how wide the light appears in the sky, the same convention as Unreal's Source Angle

## sun is about 0.53. Larger reads as a big soft sky light with penumbras that grow
## with distance from the occluder; the default is deliberately sun x ~11 so the
## softness is visible at game scale.

## deterministic, 1 = maximum per-pixel dither (fine grain).
