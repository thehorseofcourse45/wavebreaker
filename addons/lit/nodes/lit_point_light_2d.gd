class_name LitPointLight2D

## A point light for the Lit system.
##
## Draws nothing itself: the manager gathers every node in the `lit_lights` group each
## frame and packs it into the light-data texture. Shading properties are read live at
## pack time and stay fully animatable; the cull/scan-relevant ones (enabled, range,
## the shadow gates) additionally notify the registry's packed light mirror, so the
## per-frame cull never has to walk every light.
##
## `light_mask` reuses the inherited CanvasItem property (int, default 1, shown under
## "Visibility" in the inspector) rather than redeclaring it, which would collide with
## the base class. A receiver is lit by this light only if its `receiver_mask` shares a
## bit with this mask.

# Shared contracts, aliased so LitPointLight2D.BlendMode etc. remain the public

## CONE_TRACED (the default): a single signed-coverage cone march - penumbras widen
## with distance, umbras taper closed, and an antumbra re-brightens, all driven
## physically by `source_radius`. RAYMARCHED: the classic estimated-penumbra march -
## fastest, stylized, hardness-driven. STOCHASTIC: splits the source into
## `shadow_samples` sub-cones for ground-truth area shadows (correct even with several
## occluders sharing one penumbra) - the most expensive option. Every Lit receiver in
## the scene is swapped to a shader variant compiled for the algorithms in use
## automatically (by the registry each frame).

## Radius of the physical emitting disc in world pixels (CONE_TRACED / STOCHASTIC).
## Bigger sources cast softer shadows: wider penumbras and shorter umbras - an
## occluder's dark core tapers closed after roughly (occluder width / source_radius) x
## its distance to the light, so radii comparable to your occluders give clearly
## visible soft-light behavior. Distinct from `range`, which is how far the light
## reaches.

## STOCHASTIC dither inside each stratum. Samples are fractional sub-cone coverages,

## erase the faint per-stratum wedges a very wide/near source can show. 0 = fully
## deterministic, 1 = maximum per-pixel dither (fine grain).
