# Lit

**Drop-in 2D lighting for Godot 4 - with no light limit.** ([Docs](https://fadinglantern.com/docs/lit))

Lit is an alongside replacement for Godot's built-in 2D lights. It keeps the parts you
like (add a node, set some values, done) and fixes the part you don't: the hard cap of
~15 lights per object. Light a whole scene with as many lights as you want, get real soft
shadows, and stack on a pile of post-processing - all without leaving the node workflow.

> **Requires Godot 4.4+ on the Forward+ renderer.** (Mobile/Compatibility aren't supported.)

## Quickstart ([Lit Docs](https://fadinglantern.com/docs/lit))

1. **Enable the plugin.** Project → Project Settings → Plugins → turn on **Lit**. Reload
   the project if Godot asks.
2. **Make it dark.** Add a **`LitCanvasModulate`** node to your scene and set its color to
   something dark. Your world is now in shadow, waiting to be lit. *(Use this instead of
   Godot's `CanvasModulate`, not alongside it.)*
3. **Let your art catch light.** Either drop in a **`LitSprite2D`** (comes ready to go), or
   select existing `Sprite2D` / `TileMapLayer` / other 2D nodes and run
   **Project → Tools → Make Selected Nodes Lit**.
4. **Add a light.** Drop a **`LitPointLight2D`** over your art and watch it light up. Tweak
   color, energy, and range to taste.
5. **Want shadows?** On the light, tick **Shadow Enabled**. Then give the world something to
   block the light: add a `LightOccluder2D` to a sprite, or for tiles enable **SDF
   Collision** on your TileSet's occlusion layer. A sprite carrying the receiver
   material - `LitSprite2D`, tool-converted, or hand-assigned - never shadows itself:
   its occluder's shadow falls behind it (flip **Self Shadow** on the sprite if you
   want plain SDF shadowing back).
6. **Want a look?** Add a **`LitPostProcess`** node and switch on bloom, color grade, CRT,
   or any of the other effects.

That's it - everything updates live in the editor as you build.

## What you get

- **Uncapped lights & shadows.** No 15-light limit. Use as many as your scene needs.
- **Three light types.** Point, Directional (a sun), and Spot (a cone).
- **Light textures (cookies).** Drop a texture on a point or spot light to shape it -
  window panes, canopy dapple, blinds - just like the engine's `PointLight2D` texture.
  **Texture Offset** slides the cookie off the node while shadows and shading stay
  put - cycle it and a hanging lamp swings.
- **Soft or hard shadows.** One slider per light, from razor-sharp to feathery.
- **Three shadow algorithms, per light.** **Cone Traced** (the default: a single
  signed-coverage cone march driven by a physical **Source Radius** - penumbras widen
  with distance, the umbra tapers closed behind small occluders, and an antumbra
  re-brightens, beyond Unreal's penumbra-only SDF shadows at a modest cost),
  **Raymarched** (the fastest, stylized option - penumbra shaped by the hardness
  slider alone), and **Stochastic** (splits the source into sampled sub-cones -
  ground truth, correct even where several occluders share one penumbra, with
  samples/jitter dials; a cone penumbra gate keeps its cost down outside true
  penumbra). Pick per light with the **Shadow Algorithm** dropdown.
- **Normal maps & specular, free.** Reads them straight from your `CanvasTexture` - no wiring.
- **Blinn–Phong or PBR.** Pick the lighting model in Project Settings → Lit. PBR adds
  optional metallic / roughness / AO inputs on the receiver material; switch back to
  Blinn–Phong any time and the extra maps are simply ignored.
- **Darkness & ambient.** One `LitCanvasModulate` node sets the mood for the whole scene.
- **Light masks.** Make a light affect only the things you want it to.
- **Negative lights.** Flip a light to *subtract* to carve pools of extra darkness.
- **Works on any 2D node.** Sprites, tilemaps, polygons - if it draws, it can be lit.
- **Live in the editor.** See your lighting while you build, no need to hit play.
- **20+ post-processing effects** on a single node: auto exposure (eye adaptation),
  bloom, color grade, LUT presets, vignette, CRT, VHS, film grain, chromatic
  aberration, posterize, pixelate, halftone, dither, outline, halation, letterbox,
  lens distortion, light leaks, glitch, and a focus/blur-to-sharpen dial.

## The nodes

| Node | What it does |
|---|---|
| `LitPointLight2D` | A light that shines in all directions from a point. |
| `LitDirectionalLight2D` | A sun - parallel light across the whole scene. |
| `LitSpotLight2D` | A cone of light you can aim. |
| `LitCanvasModulate` | Sets the scene's darkness/ambient color. |
| `LitSprite2D` | A `Sprite2D` that's already set up to receive light. |
| `LitTileMapLayer` | A `TileMapLayer` that's already set up to receive light. |
| `LitPostProcess` | The post-processing stack (bloom, grading, CRT, and friends). |
| `LitSplashScreen` | A drop-in branded splash (glitch-fade logo, skippable). |

## Good to know

- A Lit-lit object is lit **only** by Lit; a normal object is lit only by Godot's built-in
  `Light2D`. The two systems live side by side, so you can convert a project piece by piece.
- For **tilemaps to cast shadows**, the TileSet's occlusion layer needs **SDF Collision**
  turned on (it's off by default).

## Shader precompilation

The first time your game runs on a machine, Lit prepares that machine to run your
lighting. A GPU can only run machine code built for it, and that code can't ship in a
download; games that build it mid-play are the ones that hitch the first time an
effect appears on screen. So Lit builds all of it up front: the player's graphics
driver translates every lighting and shadow shader into machine code for that exact
GPU, saved as a cache in the game's user data folder (the pipeline cache file is
literally named after the graphics card it was built for). What that preparation gets
you:

- **No lighting stutter, ever.** Every lighting and shadow shader's machine code is
  on disk before play begins; from then on, launches just load the cache. (The one
  documented exception is the post-processing passes: a pass compiles the first time
  you enable it, since Lit can't know which of the 20 your game uses. If you need a
  pass hitch-free, toggle it on once during your own loading flow.)
- **Every moment covered, not just the common ones.** Lit swaps shaders as your game
  changes state (a masked light appears, a shadow algorithm changes) - lazily-built
  caches hitch exactly there; a complete one never does.
- **Once per machine.** Precompilation returns only when the shaders change (a game
  update or a new Lit version).
- **Same fps.** Shaders run at whatever speed the card runs them - preparation just
  moves the build cost out of gameplay.

In the editor the same warm-up happens silently in the background, so precompilation
only ever runs in a running game. You choose how it runs, in Project Settings → Lit:

**Synchronous (the default).** A **Lit Shaders Precompiling** screen covers the game
until every shader is built - the classic "preparing shaders" boot screen. Fastest
total build, nothing else runs.

**Asynchronous** (`lit/startup/precompile_async`). The game starts immediately and
plays normally while a hidden second process builds the shaders in parallel at full
speed; a small floating progress box shows the countdown. Shaders your scenes demand
before they're ready still compile on the spot (a menu scene typically hits one or
two), so this trades a guaranteed-clean first session for an instant start.

**API-initiated.** Turn off `lit/startup/precompile_shaders` and run the same
worker-backed build yourself, wherever it fits your flow (a settings screen, behind
your own loader, after a "prepare shaders?" prompt):

```gdscript
if LitManager.precompile_shaders():          # false if one is already running
	LitManager.precompile_progress.connect(
		func(done, total, label): my_bar.value = float(done) / total)
	await LitManager.precompile_finished
```

**Precompile only what you use.** **Project → Tools → Generate Lit Precompile
Config** scans your scenes for actual Lit usage and writes the exact shader list to
`res://lit_precompile.cfg`. While that file exists, only what it names is built;
delete it to build everything again. Exports pack the file automatically. Regenerate
when your Lit usage changes - usage created purely from code is invisible to the
scan, and debug builds warn when a shader compiles outside the list.
